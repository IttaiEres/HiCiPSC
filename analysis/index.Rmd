This website details computational analyses done for the paper "Reorganization of 3D Genome Structure May Contribute to Gene Regulatory Evolution in Primates". In this work, I utilized Hi-C and RNA-seq to find 3-dimensional regulatory differences affecting gene expression between humans and chimpanzees. Click on any of the links below to jump to that section of the analysis. Note that I repeated the same types of analyses using different normalization and significance-calling schmes; these are the larger headers:

#### Analyses Utilizing Homer
*  [Reading in of the data, normalization, and initial quality control metrics--Figures 1, S1, S2, S8](initial_QC.html)
*  [Linear modeling of the data to find quantitative contact differences between humans and chimpanzees--No figures here, but useful for understanding Figures 2 & S3 ](linear_modeling.html)
*  [Quality control on the linear modeling, to account for p-value inflation and volcano plot asymmetry--Figures 2, S3](linear_modeling_QC.html)
*  [Orthogonal analysis with gene expression data collected from the same cell lines--Figures 4, S4, 5, ](gene_expression.html)
*  [TAD Analyses](TADs.html)
*  [Enrichment analyses on the linear-modeling significant Hi-C hits](enrichment.html)
