This website details computational analyses done for the paper "Reorganization of 3D Genome Structure May Contribute to Gene Regulatory Evolution in Primates". In this work, I utilized Hi-C and RNA-seq to find 3-dimensional regulatory differences affecting gene expression between humans and chimpanzees. Click on any of the links below to jump to that section of the analysis. Note that, for many interaction analyses, I repeated the same analysis using different normalization and significance-calling schmes (HOMER vs. Juicer); these are the larger headers:

#### Analyses Utilizing Homer
*  [Reading in of the data, normalization, and initial quality control metrics--Figures 1, S1, S2, S11](initial_QC.html)
*  [Linear modeling of the data to find quantitative contact differences between humans and chimpanzees--No figures here, but useful for understanding Figures 2 & S3 ](linear_modeling.html)
*  [Quality control on the linear modeling, to account for p-value inflation and volcano plot asymmetry--Figures 2, S3](linear_modeling_QC.html)
*  [Orthogonal analysis with gene expression data collected from the same cell lines--Figures 4, S4, 5, ](gene_expression.html)
*  [Epigenetic annotation enrichment analyses on the linear-modeling significant Hi-C hits](enrichment.html)
